# Fun_Beep_Maker
Fun little project in where I use the built in Linux beep command and implement that in a python script! It has 3 different frequencies which are Low, Middle, and High. Try making a fun little Tune!


If you are running this on Ubuntu and no beep noises come out run this command in your terminal "sudo modprobe pcspkr"
Then you should have beep noises come out. This is becuase by defaulkt beep noises are not activates on Ubuntu systems.
